What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
The code all ran successfully, publishing to an html, and creating a sqlite relational database. 

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
Always interesting to learn how to apply OOP to new concepts, like database creation.

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
Got it to work, after getting help from Srini (identifying I was missing a load_dotenv), and then following step by step with John Renken's video

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
Now I've seen 4 teachers lecture on this topic, and everyone has a different way of executing this. 

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Understanding how all these components work together. Seeing lots of people's different codes is slowly helping me understand how they interact. Still murky though.

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
I was able to debug a good number of deployment failures, and I learned more about virtual environments.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
When I ran the app locally, it failed the first two times with different error messages. The third time, it worked!

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Debugging and deploying to Heroku was very challenging. Ultimately the last steps involved fixing some periods that I missed in the imports, ex "from .models import User"
